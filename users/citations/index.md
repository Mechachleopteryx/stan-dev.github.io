# How to Cite Stan

We appreciate citations for the Stan software because it lets us find
out what people have been doing with Stan and motivate further grant
funding. When citing Stan we recommend citing both Stan itself as well
as the particular interface used. 

To cite Stan itself you can cite the Stan manual, taking the year and version from
the latest release documented at https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/:

* Stan Development Team. YEAR. Stan Modeling Language Users Guide and Reference Manual, VERSION. https://mc-stan.org

To cite the interface or post-processing package you used we recommend using the citation conventions 
for the language (R, Python, Julia, etc.) associated with the interface or package. For example, to cite 
RStan use the standard conventions for citing R packages.
