# StanCon 2020. A 24h Global Event.

## Date Confirmed: Thursday, 13 August 2020 

The Stan Conference will be virtual this year! We are aiming for a 24-hour conference that can bring the global Stan community together. There will be 3 scheduled blocks of time, each with a plenary talk and discussion for six contributed talks. Since the conference is virtual, we’re distributing most of the content ahead of the schedule.

We were looking forward to seeing everyone in person but we are excited for the opportunity to develop and deliver a virtual event that will include ways of interacting with fellow conference attendees and presenters.  If it works well we will consider a hybrid model for future conferences to ensure everyone, regardless of location and/or budget, can access and attend StanCon.

### The Format

Attendees can take part in virtual networking, attend presentations and engage with the 18 presenters.  Each block of time is scheduled similarly. Each block will have a plenary talk and 6 separate discussions of a contributed talk. Contributed talks will be pre-recorded and the content distributed online prior to the conference.

The schedule will look (roughly) like this:

- 4min	- Welcome from the StanCon Committee
- 6min	- 6x1 minute recorded pitch
- 50min - Plenary talk + Discussion
- 10min - Talk 1: 1 minute recorded pitch + 9 minute live discussion
- 10min - Talk 2: 1 minute recorded pitch + 9 minute live discussion
- 10min - Talk 3: 1 minute recorded pitch + 9 minute live discussion
- 10min - Talk 4: 1 minute recorded pitch + 9 minute live discussion
- 10min - Talk 5: 1 minute recorded pitch + 9 minute live discussion
- 10min - Talk 6: 1 minute recorded pitch + 9 minute live discussion
- 60min - Post-session virtual coffee/drinks


### What to expect

#### For attendees
We are adapting to the challenges of an online conference the best we can. We will have guides available for getting into the conference and participating.

We hope that the attendees can participate in the discussions and can have plenty of interaction with the other attendees.

All are welcome and we will be enforcing a code of conduct for the benefit of the community. This will be a registered event. The content distributed will be available online without registration, but in order to participate live, we will be requiring registration.

We will be putting up guides, the agenda and a link to register closer to the event.

#### For contributors

Since this is virtual, the format and requirements for the talks will be different. These things are expected before and during the event:

Presenters must send the following by the deadline:

- Bio [100 words] and summary of your talk [300 words] **1 July**.
The StanCon committee will notify acceptance by 8 July.
- A pre-recorded 20 minute talk once the talk has been accepted. We will help with video editing and distributing the content. We will send out some technical information about how to format slides, etc. (If you are comfortable in multiple languages, feel free to record multiple videos!) **24 July**
- A pre-recorded 1 minute pitch of the talk. The purpose of this is to let the audience know what the talk is and to jog their memory. **24 July**
- Provide consent for StanCon to share their talk online at the conference and on YouTube **24 July**

    If you have already sent your talk proposal and wish to continue participating under the virtual format, we will ask you to fill the google form again under the time zone you would prefer to participate.

StanCon 2020 going virtual! (May 16, 2020)

Dear Stan community, 

On behalf of the StanCon organizing committee we would like to update the community on the status of the conference and announce that this year StanCon is going virtual. The originally planned StanCon at Oregon State University will take place in summer 2021, with the date to be confirmed within the next few weeks. As stated in our last update, the safety of attendees is the top priority for the organizing committee. 

The conference was scheduled to take place between August 11–14, 2020, and the organizing committee will select one of these dates for the virtual conference. We will be announcing the exact day and fees in the next week, so please check the [StanCon 2020](https://mc-stan.org/events/stancon2020/) website and discourse forum for updates.

For current registrants, thank you for your support! We will refund your full registration fees immediately and let you know when there is updated registration.

In the meantime, please continue to send in talks and session proposals! If you have questions or comments, feel free to contact the StanCon organizing committee. 

Thank you everyone,
Stan Conference Organizing Committee

COVID-19 update (March 23, 2020)

Dear Stan community, 

On behalf of the StanCon organizing committee we would like to update the community on the status of StanCon 2020 given the ongoing spread of COVID-19.

The conference is still scheduled to take place between August 11–14, 2020 at Oregon State University. The safety of attendees is the top priority of the organizing committee and if the spread of COVID-19 continues to pose a high risk, the organizing committee will lamentably cancel the event. 

The StanCon committee will post an update by the first week of June to communicate the status of the conference. The information and response to the virus is rapidly changing and rather than responding acutely to each new bit of information, we are hopeful that StanCon 2020 can continue as planned.

For current registrants that need to cancel, we will refund your full registration fees. If StanCon 2020 is cancelled, all registration fees will be refunded automatically.

In the meantime, please continue to send in talks and session proposals! If you have questions or comments, feel free to contact the StanCon organizing committee. 

Thank you everyone,
Stan Conference Organizing Committee
